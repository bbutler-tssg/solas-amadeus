    "# Uploading data from FUM extracts to neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current status\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, Joel queries FUM by using the `elasticsearch` webform. Because of the memory required\n",
    "to render the results in his browser, he limits the results to 5000 records for each query that he runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical fields are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Type` represent different applications (etk, dcs and couchbase in the extracts provided by Joel).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Prefix`. In principle, this can be parsed to extract the `DcxID` and `TreeId`, which together enable a given FUM\n",
    "record to be linked to a Cormel single `Usegment`. However, sometimes the `Prefix` just contains the `DcxID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `TransactionStatus`. Generally this can be either `OK` (success) or `KO` (failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `TransactionCode` and `TransactionSubcode`. Some document types (such as `etkDocument`) use these - they may provide\n",
    "extra context.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Error` AND `Warning` each take the form of a list of items, with each item comprising a code with explanatory text.\n",
    "These might provide supporting context when the `TransactionStatus` is `KO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is currently supplied in JSON format, and software has been written to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parse this data and extract the fields of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Process the data and output the relevant fields as in CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Load this data into a sqlite database\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Run SQL queries to analyse it and try to interpret its significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work has started to upload this data to the same Neo4j database as is used to store the `Cormel` records. In principle,\n",
    "each extracted record from FUM should map to a single `Cormel` `T` node. Unfortunately, the Cormel and FUM data was taken\n",
    "from different time periods (because the Cormel Avro extract process stopped weeks ago and FUM does not store its data\n",
    "for more than a few days). Therefore, it is not possible to update existing `Cormel` `T` records. Indeed, when \n",
    "development work has completed, `error` and `warning` nodes can be added to Neo4j, but for now, it is not possible to add\n",
    "relationships between Cormel nodes and these extra \"explanatory\" nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is still possible to examine the FUM extract in its own right, as reported here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processing pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience the processing pipeline has been collected into a single script and can be run as follows (where the\n",
    "names of the FUM data extracts are provided as a combined command line argument):\n",
    "\n",
    "    script/upload.sh \"Sample_FUM_DataSets_allWithTrxnStatus Sample_FUM_DataSets_unfilteredByTrxnStatus\"\n",
