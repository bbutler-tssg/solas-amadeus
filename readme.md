# Overview of log and CorMel data analysis during SOLAS placement

This repository summarises the results of analysing transaction logs and CorMel-derived transaction trees.

The intention is to use this data to

1. predict when a transaction tree fails to complete successfully
2. if a transaction tree failed to complete, to provide sufficient context to help operations teams to

* identify the *cause* of the problem
* to estimate the *impact* (in the sense of other services affected)

Note that, since this is a public repository, the data itself is not found in this repository, so this repository serves to report on the results, but does not provide a means to replicate the analysis.
