    "# Analysing transaction trees using neo4j and hence other tools (Gephi and yEd)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "ESI data is processed by `CorMel` into *transaction trees* with the following\n",
    "structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* CorMel defines 5 \"segments\" in all: A, E, H, T and U, which store data\n",
    "pertaining to transaction trees.\n",
    "* The common features (across all entities of the transaction tree) are stored\n",
    "in a `U` segment for each transaction tree, which acts as the root of the tree.\n",
    "* The `U` node is connected to a single `T` node, which is the transaction that\n",
    "spawns the other transactions in the tree.\n",
    "* Each transaction `T` node can have 0 or more child transactions (`T` nodes).\n",
    "* The leaf nodes can be `T` nodes, or alternatively hop (`H`) nodes, `A` or `E`\n",
    "nodes.\n",
    "* The `A` and `E` nodes often have blank properties and/or default data, and\n",
    "so are loaded into neo4j but are not used for further analysis. They appear to\n",
    "be descriptive and are shared between transaction trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each CorMel segment is associated with a standard list of fields, hence it is\n",
    "equivalent to a table in a relational database, or a node in a property graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although transaction trees have a natural mapping into graph data structures,\n",
    "this aspect of their nature has not been explored in Amadeus. The research\n",
    "hypothesis is that transaction trees can be classified into two categories,\n",
    "depending on whether they are associated with *successful* or *unsuccessful*\n",
    "outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that *success* and *failure* have specific meanings in this context. For\n",
    "example, a customer could decide to abandon a search, or even a booking, before\n",
    "completing all steps. Because the customer made the decision, Amadeus\n",
    "infrastructure was not at fault, and the incomplete transaction tree does not\n",
    "represent a problem for the Amadeus devops team to fix[^1]. Another scenario\n",
    "would be that a network link failure occurred, in which case the service\n",
    "response never arrived, so the customer had no choice and was unable to proceed\n",
    "with the transaction. As seen by the customer, the system became unresponsive,\n",
    "or even provided an error message of the form \"The system is currently\n",
    "unavailable.  Please try again later.\" Neither of these represents a\n",
    "*successful* outcome. Even worse, such problems are likely to recur, and to\n",
    "affect other customers. Hence they need to be addressed as soon as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: Perhaps the Customer Experience team might be interested in analysing\n",
    "transactions abandoned by customers, as there might be ways of improving the\n",
    "customer experience with the intention of increasing the completion rate of\n",
    "transactions. However, such offline analysis is outside the scope of the\n",
    "present study.\n",
    " \n",
    "The research hypothesis is that there are *structural* and/or *property*\n",
    "differences between successful and unsuccessful transaction trees. Furthermore,\n",
    "it might even be possible to suggest some queries that could be used to derive\n",
    "the root cause of *correlated* problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible structural difference might include highly unbalanced trees,\n",
    "reflecting the fact that, if a particular edge in the tree failed, the\n",
    "redundancy built into the Amadeus services infrastructure is such that other\n",
    "parts of the transaction might succeed (and generate lots of activity in the\n",
    "logs, hence segments in the CorMel transaction tree) although the overall\n",
    "transaction might fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Property differences could be subtle and might be more useful for root cause\n",
    "determination. For example, the transaction might invoke a service that was\n",
    "recently updated, or be directed to an endpoint that is struggling to meet\n",
    "demand. Such property data is stored in the segment records. (Graph) database\n",
    "queries might help to find common property settings across problematic\n",
    "transaction trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The processing pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "More information can be found in the related implementation documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A summary of the processing pipeline is shown in Figure 1 below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1: Overview of the processing pipeline.](img/pipeline2-CROPPED.png){height=9cm}\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point is the `CorMel` system itself, from which an Avro-format\n",
    "extract is taken on a timed basis and saved in a file, with one file per\n",
    "extract run. The given example file contained 24499 transaction trees. A (Java)\n",
    "program was written to upload this data to a `Neo4j` database, where it is\n",
    "represented as a graph, with the `U`, `T`, `H`, `A` and `E` segments from\n",
    "CorMel being stored as Neo4j nodes, linked together with Neo4j edges that\n",
    "represent the *flow* of the transaction trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Samples of such data can be exported in Graphml format from Neo4j and stored in\n",
    "(data-oriented, not graphics-oriented) files that are optimised for the `Gephi`\n",
    "and `yEd` applications, where they can be visualised and analysed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each of these applications, the nodes and edges are\n",
    "assigned (`x`,`y`) coordinates according to the layout algorithms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is easier to interpret transaction trees by highlighting them in the context of other\n",
    "transaction trees, so a python program was written to generate modify the edge colour\n",
    "so that highlighted transaction trees have edges coloured black and other trees have edges\n",
    "that are light grey in colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to run standard graph algorithms on the data in Neo4j, or alternatively\n",
    "in `Gephi` or `yEd`. The results of such analysis are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminary analysis results\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the preliminary analysis results are based on a\n",
    "sample data of 20 transaction trees, ignoring the `A` and `E` segment nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first interesting feature is that the number of components is 8 rather than\n",
    "20 (the number of (logical) transaction trees), because of the presence of shared\n",
    "nodes (and even edges).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compare highlighted tree #1 using yEd's `circular` and `treeBalloon` layouts,\n",
    "we see that certain features are relatively stable between the two representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 2: Highlighted tree #1, for 20 tree sample, yEd's \"circular\" layout, annotated to show features in coloured boxes.](img/sample20yed_circular_hl01.png){height=9cm}\n",
    "\n",
    "The box on the right, with a pale green background, shows a relatively simple\n",
    "arrangement of isolated trees, differing in size from 3 nodes (`U`, `T` and\n",
    "`H`) to a much larger tree with many nodes. The box with the pale blue\n",
    "background includes most nodes in transaction tree 1, except for a branch that\n",
    "leads to a shared node. The box with the yellow background includes most nodes\n",
    "of two trees, except for their own version of the branch that leads to the same\n",
    "node that is shared with transaction tree 1. The box with the pale orange\n",
    "background includes both simple and shared edges associated with a particular\n",
    "node. There is a lot of complexity here, which is worthy of further study.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 3: Highlighted tree #1, for 20 tree sample, yEd's \"treeBalloon\" layout, annotated to show features in coloured boxes.](img/sample20yed_treeBalloon_hl01.png){height=9cm}\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 and Figure 3 are very similar, with slightly different ways of showing\n",
    "the more complex overlapping transaction trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, yEd is also able to display certain analytical properties of graphs.\n",
    "For this study, the following graphs were considered interesting. Firstly, the\n",
    "number of edges connected to each node (its *degree*) is a measure of how many\n",
    "service endpoints are tasked with work from that node. If any of these service\n",
    "endpoints fails to provide a response, the transaction tree could block at that\n",
    "node. See Figure 4 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 4: 20 tree sample, yEd's \"treeBalloon\" layout, showing the (out)degree for each node.](img/sample20yed_treeBalloon_numberConnectedEdges.png){height=9cm}\n",
    "\n",
    "The node's degree provides a \"local\" measure of the work passing through that\n",
    "node.  However, the node's position in the tree also affects the flow of data\n",
    "and control. The *paths* of these flows should also be considered. One such\n",
    "measure is the node's *betweenness centrality*, which is represented in Figure\n",
    "5.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 5: 20 tree sample, yEd's \"treeBalloon\" layout, showing the betweenness centrality for each node.](img/sample20yed_treeBalloon_nodeBetweennessCentrality.png){height=9cm}\n",
    "\n",
    "The ranking of nodes (according to the computed metric) changes between Figures\n",
    "4 and 5, reflecting the differing weighting of local and global information\n",
    "relating to the transaction tree(s) containing that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast with yEd, Gephi provides *reports* on various conceptually-linked\n",
    "graph metrics in the form of HTML pages referencing PNG plots of those metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 6 below indicates that there are 3 components with very few nodes, but\n",
    "with other transaction trees having significantly more nodes (~300 nodes in one\n",
    "case).  More analysis would be needed to determine whether the distribution of\n",
    "component size might be a good predictor of whether a transaction tree has\n",
    "succeeded or failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 6: 20 tree sample: the component size distribution for the 8 weakly connected components.](connectedComponentsReport/cc-size-distribution.png){height=9cm}\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph *diameter* was found to be 9, with an average path length just\n",
    "exceeding 3.  Therefore, a `U->T->T->H` path is average path through the\n",
    "transaction trees in the sample. Perhaps the distribution of path lengths might\n",
    "be a good predictor, but this is not computed by Gephi (although it could be\n",
    "computed, with a little effort, in Neo4j).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gephi provides plots of *betweenness centrality*, *closeness centrality* and\n",
    "*eccentricity*, see Figures 7, 8 and 9 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 7: 20 tree sample: the Betweenness Centrality distribution.](graphDistanceReport/Betweenness Centrality Distribution.png){height=9cm}\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 8: 20 tree sample: the Closeness Centrality distribution.](graphDistanceReport/Closeness Centrality Distribution.png){height=9cm}\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 9: 20 tree sample: the Eccentricity distribution.](graphDistanceReport/Eccentricity Distribution.png){height=9cm}\n",
    "\n",
    "In Figure 7, most of the mass of the Betweenness Centrality distribution can be\n",
    "found near 0, but there is also a relatively long tail. In Figure 8, the\n",
    "Closeness Centrality has two relatively common values (0 and 1) and the\n",
    "remainder lie in between. According to Figure 9, Eccentricity takes values\n",
    "between 0 and 9, with a preference for lower values.  It has arguably the\n",
    "simplest of the three distributions and so might be easiest to compare between\n",
    "successful and failed transaction trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Labeling the transaction trees\n",
    "\n",
    "### The role of Application Events\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the companion implementation document, AppEvents record the\n",
    "`TransactionStatus` of transactions affected by certain events. A \"filterfirst\" strategy was\n",
    "followed to load only those CorMel transaction trees for which at least one of\n",
    "their transactions appeared in the AppEvent extract used to filter the incoming\n",
    "CorMel transaction trees. Consequently the volume of data is much reduced and this\n",
    "type of filtering is also intended to select transaction trees that were affected by\n",
    "known incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature worth noting is that `DcxId` has been added to the set of properties\n",
    "in each transaction node, rather than being inherited implicitly from the parent `U`\n",
    "node. This makes matching (against AppEvents) much easier but a consequence of this change\n",
    "is that transaction nodes are no longer shared between transaction trees. Such trees become\n",
    "disconnected from each other, making visualisation and interpretation easier. This should\n",
    "be noted in the graph layouts shown later.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Preliminary analysis of results from the outage\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the cypher query\n",
    "\n",
    "    MATCH (n:Tsegment) WHERE n.TransactionStatus IS NOT NULL RETURN n.TransactionStatus AS TransactionStatus, COUNT(*) AS Count;\n",
    "\n",
    "we obtain the data below.\n",
    "\n",
    "TransactionStatus|Count\n",
    "--- | ---\n",
    "OK|730\n",
    "KO|40\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore AppEvent includes both successful (`TransactionStatus` = OK) and\n",
    "unsuccessful (`TransactionStatus` = KO) transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also interesting to note the effect of the filtering. Using\n",
